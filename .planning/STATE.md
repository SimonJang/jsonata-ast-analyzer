# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** Given any JSONata expression, accurately identify every data path read from the input object -- including paths accessed through variable assignments, filter predicates, and function arguments.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation and Basic Walker

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation and Basic Walker)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Over-approximate by default -- report a superset of actual paths rather than risk missing paths
- [Roadmap]: Build custom AST types because official ExprNode is incomplete (missing path, filter, sort, bind, apply nodes)
- [Roadmap]: Two-pass architecture (walk then resolve) to avoid variable ordering issues
- [01-01]: Package name jsonata-ast-analyzer chosen for broader scope
- [01-01]: Single cast boundary in parse() -- all downstream code uses discriminated unions
- [01-01]: GenericNode catch-all for forward compatibility with unhandled AST node types

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Official `ExprNode` TypeScript type is incomplete -- custom types needed as Phase 1 foundation
- `stages` property on path step nodes (for filters/sorts/groups) needs empirical validation in Phase 1
